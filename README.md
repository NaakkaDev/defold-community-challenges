# [Defold](https://defold.com) community challenges

This project was created from the "mobile" project template. All my community challenge creations will live here.

**Try it out here:** <https://temeez.github.io/defold-community-challenges/>

**Note**: I like pixel art so this project contains a customized render_script to keep the resolution "pixel perfect". That means 270x480 (x1), 540x960 (x2) and so on.
